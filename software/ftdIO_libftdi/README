The following instructions allow one to generate:

a) an executable file (ftdIO) that can be used to read/write to HFT-RDO firmware registers
b) a python-importable shared library (ftdIOmodule.so) that allows for higher level operations (such as sending packets of commands to the firmware and receiving long data)


Procedure for (a)

1) export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib

2) From the ftdIO_libftdi folder, run:

   make

   This will create an executable file (ftdIO) in this folder

3) (optional) Create a symbolic link to the executable file in your work folder:
   
   ln -s ftdIO_libftdi/ftdIO .



Procedure for (b)

1) From the ftdIO_libftdi folder, run: 

  python setup.py build

  This will create the shared library "ftdIOmodule.so" in the directory "liftdIO_libftdi/build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.6"

2) (optional) Create a symbolic link to the executable file in your work folder:

  ln -s ftdIO_libftdi_readFIFO/build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.6/ftdIO.so .
