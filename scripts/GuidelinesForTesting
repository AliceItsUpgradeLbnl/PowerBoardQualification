Steps for testing a production power board:

IMPORTANT NOTE: Make sure you wear protection glasses when testing power boards. Polarized capacitors, if loaded uncorrectly, can explode and damage your eyes.

1)  Pick one of the power boards that has a LBNL label on it. Never test unlabelled power boards.
2)  Place the power board in the power board testing area.
3)  Connect the chiller hoses to the power board.
4)  Switch on the chiller. Make sure that the temperature reaches the preset value and check that there are no leaks in the hoses.
5)  Connect both power units to the two sets of "low current loads" - To do so plug the two corresponding breakout boards to the power board front panel.
6)  Connect the 3.3V input power cable to the power board.
7)  Connect the -5V input power cable to power board.
8)  Connect the I2C ribble cables (flat) to Power Unit Right and Power Unit Left according to the labels on the power board and cables.
9)  Run the tests using the GUI (see below).
10) When the test with low current loads is completed, do the following:
   a) Repeat procedure from step 6 to 9 with "nominal current loads"
   b) Repeat procedure from step 6 to 9 with "high current loads"
11) When all tests are done, disconnect all the cables, loads and chiller hoses (in reverse order wrt what described above).
12) Remove all water from the power board heat exchanger, using paper and compressed air.
13) Store the tested power board in the designated cabinet.

FINAL NOTE: If one of the tests on a power board fails, conclude the tests with the current loads then follow steps 11 and 12 to disconnect the power board
from the testing station. Once that is done put a label on the power board to mark it as non-working and add to it the name of the test(s) that didn't pass
and which load was used. Don't put the power board in the designated power board cabinet, leave it on the bench near the power board testing station.

Operation of the production power board GUI:

1) Open a terminal and type "gotestproduction" then press "ENTER"
2) Run "./GUI"
